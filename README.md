# RapidMiner_CropDamage_Estimation
The Rapidminer Tool is used in this project to analyse and visualise the data from the dataset.
RapidMiner is a data science software platform developed by the company of the same name that provides an integrated environment for data.
A Crop Damage Dataset is used and uploaded to the rapidminer tools.

Three Algorithms are used and compared in order to find the highest accuracy among them.
1) Decision Tree Algorithm.
2) Gradient Boost Algorithm.
3) Random Forest Algorithm.

The Gradient Boost Algorithm has the highest Accuracy, and the Random Forest has the lowest accuracy.
